Messaging Queue :

Producer ------ queue ------- Consumer

use case:

1. Asynchronus (low latency)
2. Matches Pace

--- Working

- Producer creates messaged and push it to a queue and consumed by the Consumer .
- it is used to handle large amount of data

1. Async task

-- Ecom server ---- generated notifications ----- pushes into queue ----- process by Consumer
-- this condition can handle failure ,and order

2. Suppose 3 services are producing different transactions, and the consumer has a fixed rate.
   in that case we use a queue to process the data accordingly.

example:

for car rental company

Car A, car B, car C sending gps data every 10s at 30m/s,15m/s,20m/s, and the consumer can update/consume at 15m/s
so to handle the state we will process using a messaging queue.

what is Point2Point and Publisher/Subscriber Messaging type ?

p2p: where the msg generated by producer pushed to queue, can be consumed by a single consumer only
-- Producer -- queue --- consumer 1,
example: Task distribution, order processing

publisher/subcriber: where the msg generated by producer pushed to queue, can be consumed by a multiple consumers

### Point-to-Point (PTP) and Publish/Subscribe (Pub/Sub) Messaging Models

#### 1. Point-to-Point (PTP) Model

### Comparison

| Aspect               | Point-to-Point (PTP)                | Publish/Subscribe (Pub/Sub)        |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Component**        | Queue                               | Topic                              |
| **Message Receiver** | Single consumer                     | Multiple subscribers               |
| **Use Case**         | Task distribution, order processing | Broadcasting events, notifications |
| **Message Delivery** | One-to-one                          | One-to-many                        |
| **Message Removal**  | Removed after consumption           | Retained for all subscribers       |

### Conclusion

Both PTP and Pub/Sub models are essential in messaging systems, each serving different purposes. PTP is ideal for scenarios where a message should be processed by only one consumer, while Pub/Sub is suitable for scenarios where messages need to be broadcast to multiple consumers. Understanding the differences and appropriate use cases for each model is crucial for designing effective messaging solutions.

How Kafka Supports One-to-Many:
Single Consumer Group (PTP): Messages are processed by one consumer in the group, making it PTP within the group.
Multiple Consumer Groups (Pub/Sub): Messages are processed by consumers in multiple groups independently, supporting the Pub/Sub model.
