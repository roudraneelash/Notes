When we are designing a Notification, client needs to request updates from the server.

scenario 1:Using HTTPs request.

Long Polling: where the client will initiate requests every 5sec, to check for new updates. but here it will face performance issue, as HTTPs is a stateless protocol,
i.e every request is returned with a response and the connection is closed.

so, when every 5sec new request is being made, the server needs to verify and make the connection.

Scenario 2:
there is a persistent connection with the server and client, i.e the connection is not closed after 1st response, the server will send the new data to the client.
