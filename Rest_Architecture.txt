- Rest architecture (Represented state transfer) architecture , it is used for designing distributed we services.
- works on Client-server architecture
- the clients demand code on request from the server , and the server response in JSON/HTML.
- Stateless architecture, i.e each request is made via HTTP/HTTPS containing all the necessary requests. in between request the server does'nt store any state of the client.

The uniform interface is often implemented using HTTP methods such as:

	•	GET: Retrieve data from the server.
	•	POST: Submit data to the server, often resulting in resource creation.
	•	PUT: Update a resource on the server.
	•	DELETE: Remove a resource from the server.

Advantages of REST:

	•	Scalability: Stateless nature and caching make RESTful systems scalable.
	•	Flexibility: REST is language and platform-agnostic, making it highly interoperable.
	•	Simplicity: Uses standard web protocols (HTTP) and formats (JSON, XML).
	•	Modularity: The separation of client and server simplifies system maintenance and upgrades.

----------- Stateful architecture

Key Characteristics of Stateful Architectures:

	•	Server Maintains State: The server needs to remember information about client interactions between requests, which makes the system more complex.
	•	Session-based: Clients usually establish sessions with the server, where session information is retained for the duration of the interaction.
	•	Less Scalable: Stateful architectures are generally harder to scale because each interaction depends on the server’s knowledge of previous interactions.
	•	Example Protocols: FTP, WebSockets, stateful HTTP sessions, and traditional database connections are all examples of stateful systems.
