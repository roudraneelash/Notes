Sure, let's create some structured notes on stack and heap memory in Java, along with garbage collection:

### Stack Memory

- **Purpose**: 
  - Stores temporary variables and method calls.
  - Handles method invocation and local variables.

- **Characteristics**:
  - Each thread in Java has its own stack.
  - Operates in Last In First Out (LIFO) order.
  - Stores primitive data types and references to objects in heap.

- **Usage**:
  - Variables within a method scope are stored here.
  - Memory is reclaimed when the method completes.

- **Errors**:
  - When stack memory is full, it throws `java.lang.StackOverflowError`.

### Heap Memory

- **Purpose**: 
  - Stores objects and their instance variables.

- **Characteristics**:
  - Shared among all threads.
  - Objects are allocated dynamically here.

- **Usage**:
  - Stores class-level data like static variables.
  - Objects persist until they are no longer referenced.

- **Garbage Collection**:
  - Mechanism for reclaiming unused memory.
  - Identifies objects without references (unreachable) and frees their memory.
  - Managed by JVM with algorithms like Mark-Sweep, Copying, and Generational.

### Garbage Collector (GC)

- **Functionality**:
  - Identifies and removes objects that are no longer needed.
  - Optimizes memory usage and prevents memory leaks.

- **Types of References**:
  - **Strong Reference**: Keeps object in memory until explicitly dereferenced.
  - **Weak Reference**: Allows GC to collect object when it's only weakly referenced.
  - **Soft Reference**: GC collects object only when memory is low.
  - **Phantom Reference**: GC notifies before collecting object.

### Summary

- **Stack**:
  - Handles method calls and local variables.
  - Thread-specific, LIFO order.
  - Stores primitive types and object references.

- **Heap**:
  - Stores objects and class-level variables.
  - Shared among threads.
  - Managed by JVM, supports dynamic memory allocation.

- **Garbage Collection**:
  - Automates memory management.
  - Ensures efficient memory usage.
  - Different types of references allow for varying degrees of object retention.

These notes should help in understanding how stack and heap memory work in Java, along with the role of the garbage collector in managing memory efficiently.
