For Java 8, interview questions typically focus on the new features introduced in the release. Here are the key topics you should prepare for:

1. Lambda Expressions

	•	Syntax and usage of lambdas.
	•	Functional interfaces (e.g., Runnable, Callable, Predicate, Function).
	•	Use cases of lambdas in collections (sorting, filtering, mapping).
	•	Capturing local variables in lambdas.

2. Stream API

	•	Stream creation and operations: intermediate (e.g., map(), filter(), distinct(), sorted()) and terminal operations (e.g., collect(), forEach(), reduce()).
	•	Difference between sequential and parallel streams.
	•	Collectors (e.g., toList(), toSet(), groupingBy(), partitioningBy()).
	•	Lazy evaluation in streams.

3. Functional Interfaces

	•	Built-in functional interfaces (Function, Predicate, Supplier, Consumer, BiFunction).
	•	Creating custom functional interfaces.

4. Method References

	•	Types of method references: static methods, instance methods, and constructors.
	•	Syntax and use cases.

5. Optional Class

	•	Purpose of Optional to avoid null checks.
	•	Methods like isPresent(), ifPresent(), orElse(), orElseThrow(), map(), and flatMap().

6. Default and Static Methods in Interfaces

	•	Purpose of default methods in interfaces.
	•	Implementing multiple interfaces with default methods.
	•	Use cases for static methods in interfaces.

7. Date and Time API (java.time)

	•	Classes like LocalDate, LocalTime, LocalDateTime, Period, Duration, ZonedDateTime.
	•	Manipulating dates and times (e.g., adding/subtracting, formatting, and parsing).
	•	Thread-safety of the new Date and Time API compared to java.util.Date.

8. Concurrent API Enhancements

	•	CompletableFuture: asynchronous programming with methods like supplyAsync(), thenApply(), thenAccept().
	•	Enhancements in fork/join pool and parallelism.

9. Nashorn JavaScript Engine

	•	Running JavaScript code from Java using the Nashorn engine.
	•	Basic understanding of how Java and JavaScript interact.

10. Collectors API

	•	Predefined collectors like toList(), toMap(), joining(), groupingBy(), partitioningBy().
	•	Custom collectors using Collector.of().

11. Stream Performance and Parallel Streams

	•	When to use parallel streams.
	•	Performance considerations and pitfalls of parallelism.

Preparing for these topics should give you solid coverage of Java 8 and its new features, which are often tested in interviews.
