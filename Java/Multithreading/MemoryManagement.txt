there are primarily 2 memory types in Java

1- stack
2- heap

Both stack and Heap are created by JVM and stored in RAM.

Stack memory:
- store Temporary Variables and seperate memory block for methods.
- store Primitive data types.
- store reference of the heap objects.
  -- strong reference
  -- weak reference

- Each thread has its own Stack memory.
- Variables within a scope is only  visible and as soon as any variable goes out of the scope, it get deleted.
from the stack(in LIFO order)
- when stack memory goes full, it throws "java.lang.StackOverflowError"

-- so for reference datatype, the variable gets created in the heap memory , and the reference is stored in the stack memory.


-- define the heap and stack working
-- garbage collector
