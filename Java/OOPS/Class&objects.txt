-- Access specifiers 
- public - can be accessed everywhere
- private - only within the class
- protected - within the package and subclass of a another package
- default - can only be accessed from the same package.

-- static block 
it is the 1st block when class execution
-- non-static block , everytime the object is created

public class Singleton {
	static int count=0;
	String name;
	int age;
	
	public Singleton()
	{
		count++;
	}
	
	public Singleton(String name,int age)
	{
		this.name=name;
		this.age=age;
	}
	
	public void showDetails(){
		System.out.println("Instance count :"+count+"\nname: "+this.name+"\nage:"+this.age);
	}
	static {
		System.out.println("From Singleton class");
	}
	{
		System.out.println("Singleton Object is created");
	}
}

-- OOPS concepts

- Polymorphism (overloading/overriding)
- inheritance (extends, implements)
- abstraction (binding the logic inside a method)
- encapsulation (private properties, getters and setters)

-- Abstract class - partial abstract , means not all the methods are defined
-- interface is all the methods are abstract 
-- variable is public static final.
