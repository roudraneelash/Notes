http - it is a stateless protocol, i.e each request is independent of each other/next request
 
 i.e to identify the user , once a session id is created and sent to the client side,
 to verify each user/session , the sessionID is sent along with the request to validate/authenticate the request.

 in the client side , the session is stored in cookied , and in server side it is stored in the server


 -- use express-session to store session details, to secure the routes
 app.use(session({
  secret: 'keyboard cat',
  //secret key to encrypt the details
  resave: false,
  saveUninitialized: true,
  cookie: { secure: true }
  //here secure means , can access only through https , if false means http
}))


-- cookies, cookie-parser, it parse cookie header from client side and populate req.cookies
