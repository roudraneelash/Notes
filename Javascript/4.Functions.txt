- Functions in Js, it is a block of code to execute/ perform a specific task .
- it has its one execution context, i.e the variables inside function cannot be accessed outside the function scope.
- Hoisting is different for function declaration & function expressions
- important concept known as Closure.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Function scope

function a(){
  var b=1;
}
console.log(b);//throws an error, as b is not accessible outside the function scope.

- Functional Hoisting

a();//it will execute, as the function declarations are moved to the top of the script,
b();//it will throw an error, as only the variable is hoisted, function body is not initialized.
function a(){
  console.log("function declaration");
}
const b=()=>{
  console.log("function expression");
}
