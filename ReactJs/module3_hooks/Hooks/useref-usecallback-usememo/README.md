The useMemo hook in React is used to memoize the result of a computation so that it is only recalculated when its dependencies change. This can provide performance optimizations by avoiding unnecessary recalculations.

UseCallback is use to make referential api calls ,

useMemo stores the return value
useCallback stored the function itself
useRef is use to not re-render the component
