The lifecycle of Spring beans is a crucial concept in understanding how Spring manages the creation, initialization, use, and destruction of beans. Here is a step-by-step explanation of the lifecycle of Spring beans:

1. Bean Definition
   XML Configuration: Defined in applicationContext.xml.
   Annotation-based Configuration: Using @Component, @Service, @Repository, @Controller, etc.
   Java-based Configuration: Using @Bean annotated methods in @Configuration classes.
2. Bean Instantiation
   Singleton Scope: A single instance is created and shared.
   Prototype Scope: A new instance is created every time it is requested.
3. Dependency Injection
   Spring resolves and injects dependencies into the bean either via:
   Constructor Injection
   Setter Injection
   Field Injection (using @Autowired, @Inject, etc.)
4. Bean Initialization
   @PostConstruct: Custom initialization logic can be executed after the dependencies are injected using the @PostConstruct annotation.
   InitializingBean Interface: Implement afterPropertiesSet method for custom initialization.
   Custom init-method: Specified in the bean configuration (XML or @Bean annotation).
5. Bean Usage
   The bean is ready to be used by the application. It can be injected into other beans and participate in the application logic.
6. Bean Destruction
   @PreDestroy: Custom destruction logic can be executed just before the bean is destroyed using the @PreDestroy annotation.
   DisposableBean Interface: Implement destroy method for custom destruction logic.
   Custom destroy-method: Specified in the bean configuration (XML or @Bean annotation).
   Detailed Lifecycle Steps
   Spring Container Starts: The Spring container starts and reads the configuration files/classes.
   Bean Definitions: The container loads the bean definitions and creates metadata for each bean.
   Instantiation: The container creates an instance of the bean.
   Populate Properties: The container injects dependencies (properties) into the bean.
   BeanNameAware: If the bean implements BeanNameAware, Spring passes the bean's name to setBeanName.
   BeanFactoryAware: If the bean implements BeanFactoryAware, Spring passes the BeanFactory to setBeanFactory.
   ApplicationContextAware: If the bean implements ApplicationContextAware, Spring passes the ApplicationContext to setApplicationContext.
   BeanPostProcessor: If any BeanPostProcessor is registered, its postProcessBeforeInitialization method is called.
   Custom Init Methods: If the bean implements InitializingBean, afterPropertiesSet is called. If the bean has a @PostConstruct method, it is called. If a custom init-method is specified, it is called.
