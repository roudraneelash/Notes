Repository<T,ID>
this is the root interface in Spring Data. it provides basic functionality for interacting with the underlying data store, like finding entities by their ID.

CrudRepository<T,ID>
this interface extends Repository and adds CRUD(Create,Read,Update,Delete) operations.it provides methods for saving, deleting, finding all entities, and finding entities by ID.

PagingAndSortingRepository<T,ID>
extends CrudRepository and adds support for paginatoin and sorting of results. You can specify page size, page number, and sorting criteria.

JpaRepository<T,ID>:
this interface extends PagingAndSortingRepository and provides additional JPA-specific features,such as flushing the persistence context, batch operations, and the ability to use JPQL queries.

Yes, the `JpaRepository` interface in Spring Data JPA extends the `PagingAndSortingRepository` interface, which in turn extends the `CrudRepository` interface. This means that `JpaRepository` inherits all the methods from `CrudRepository` and `PagingAndSortingRepository`, and it also adds some JPA-specific methods. Here's a breakdown of what each interface provides:

### CrudRepository

The `CrudRepository` interface provides methods for basic CRUD operations:

- `save(S entity)`: Saves a given entity.
- `saveAll(Iterable<S> entities)`: Saves all given entities.
- `findById(ID id)`: Retrieves an entity by its id.
- `existsById(ID id)`: Checks if an entity exists by its id.
- `findAll()`: Returns all entities.
- `findAllById(Iterable<ID> ids)`: Returns all entities by their ids.
- `count()`: Returns the number of entities.
- `deleteById(ID id)`: Deletes the entity by its id.
- `delete(T entity)`: Deletes a given entity.
- `deleteAll(Iterable<? extends T> entities)`: Deletes all given entities.
- `deleteAll()`: Deletes all entities.

### PagingAndSortingRepository

The `PagingAndSortingRepository` interface extends `CrudRepository` and provides methods to retrieve entities using pagination and sorting:

- `findAll(Sort sort)`: Returns all entities sorted by the given options.
- `findAll(Pageable pageable)`: Returns a `Page` of entities meeting the paging restriction provided in the `Pageable` object.

### JpaRepository

The `JpaRepository` interface extends `PagingAndSortingRepository` and adds JPA-specific methods:

- `findAll()`: Returns all entities.
- `findAll(Sort sort)`: Returns all entities sorted by the given options.
- `findAllById(Iterable<ID> ids)`: Returns all entities by their ids.
- `findAll(Pageable pageable)`: Returns a `Page` of entities meeting the paging restriction provided in the `Pageable` object.
- `save(S entity)`: Saves a given entity.
- `saveAll(Iterable<S> entities)`: Saves all given entities.
- `flush()`: Flushes all pending changes to the database.
- `saveAndFlush(S entity)`: Saves an entity and flushes changes instantly.
- `deleteInBatch(Iterable<T> entities)`: Deletes the given entities in a batch.
- `deleteAllInBatch()`: Deletes all entities in a batch.
- `getOne(ID id)`: Retrieves an entity by its id lazily.

### Conclusion

By extending `JpaRepository`, you get all the methods from `CrudRepository` and `PagingAndSortingRepository`, as well as additional methods specific to JPA. This makes `JpaRepository` the most feature-rich repository interface in Spring Data JPA, providing comprehensive functionality for CRUD operations, pagination, sorting, and JPA-specific operations.

------------------------------- How Hibernate is executed in JPA

The `EntityManager` is part of the Java Persistence API (JPA) specification, not specific to Hibernate. Hibernate is one of the implementations of the JPA specification. When you use `EntityManager` in a Spring Data JPA application, it is typically backed by Hibernate as the JPA provider. Here's a more detailed explanation:

### What is `EntityManager`?

- **`EntityManager`**: This is the primary JPA interface for interacting with the persistence context. It provides methods for CRUD operations, querying, and transaction management. It's a part of the JPA specification and is implemented by various JPA providers like Hibernate, EclipseLink, and others.

### How does Hibernate relate to `EntityManager`?

- **Hibernate**: Hibernate is a popular Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool and one of the implementations of the JPA specification. When Hibernate is used as the JPA provider, it implements the `EntityManager` interface and its methods.

### Example of `EntityManager` in JPA with Hibernate

When you use the `EntityManager` in a Spring Data JPA application, it delegates the actual database operations to Hibernate:

```java
import javax.persistence.EntityManager;
import javax.persistence.PersistenceContext;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Repository;
import org.springframework.transaction.annotation.Transactional;

@Repository
public class ProductRepositoryCustomImpl implements ProductRepositoryCustom {

    @PersistenceContext
    private EntityManager entityManager;

    @Transactional
    public void customMethod() {
        // Hibernate is the JPA provider here
        Product product = entityManager.find(Product.class, 1);
        // Hibernate handles the underlying SQL generation and execution
    }
}
```

### How it Works

1. **EntityManager**: You interact with the `EntityManager` to perform operations like `persist`, `find`, `merge`, `remove`, etc.
2. **Hibernate**: As the JPA provider, Hibernate implements these operations. When you call `entityManager.find(Product.class, 1)`, Hibernate generates the appropriate SQL (`SELECT * FROM Product WHERE id = 1`) and executes it against the database.
3. **Persistence Context**: The `EntityManager` maintains a first-level cache called the persistence context. Hibernate manages this cache and ensures that entities are fetched and stored according to the JPA specification.

### Integration in Spring Data JPA

In Spring Data JPA, repository interfaces like `JpaRepository` abstract away the use of `EntityManager`, but under the hood, they still rely on it and Hibernate:

```java
public interface ProductRepository extends JpaRepository<Product, Integer> {
    // Custom query methods can be defined here
}
```

When you call methods on `ProductRepository`, Spring Data JPA uses the `EntityManager` to perform the operations. Hibernate, being the JPA provider, executes these operations.

### Summary

- `EntityManager` is a JPA interface for managing the persistence context and interacting with the database.
- Hibernate is an implementation of the JPA specification and provides the actual functionality behind the `EntityManager` methods.
- In a Spring Data JPA application, `EntityManager` is typically backed by Hibernate, making Hibernate responsible for the actual database interactions.
