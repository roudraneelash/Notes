// the Newton-Raphson method can be used to find the sq root of a number N as follows:
- make an initial guess
- Update the guess using the below formula
- New Estimate = current Estimate- (F(Current Estimate)/F'(Current Estimate) ), where 
F(Current Estimate)= Current Estimate * Current Estimate - N
F'(Current Estimate)=2* Current Estimate

- Repeate till you close enough
