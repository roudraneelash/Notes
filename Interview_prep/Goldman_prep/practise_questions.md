16.Find the missing number in an interger array of N-1 numbers such that it contains only distinct integers from 1 to N. 17. Given an array of integers where each elements represent the max numbers of steps that can be made forward from that element.Write a function to return the minimum number of jumps to reach the end of the array.(starting from the first element). if ab element is 0, they cannot move through that element. if the end isn'nt reachable return -1;

input: arr[]: {1,3,5,8,9,2,6,7,6,8,9}
output: 3{1->3->9->9} 18. Given an array of N integers and an integer K, find the number of pairs of elements in the array whose sum is equal to k.
19.Check if Binary tree is Balanced Binary tree or not.
20.Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
example 1:
Input: s="abcabcbb"
Output:3 21. Find the maximum amount of water that can be trapped within given set of bars where each bar's width is 1unit. 22. Write an input string , write a function that returns the Run Length encoded string for the input string.input: Str: "wwwwaaadexxxxxx", output: "w4a3d1e1x6" 23. Let 1 represent 'A', 2 represent 'B', and so on. Given a digit of sequence, count number of possible decoding's of the given digit sequence. Input: digits[]:"121", output 3 24. Given an array of string words, group the anagrams together. You can return the answer in any order.An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase .
