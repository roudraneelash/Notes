Here's a consolidated list of all the questions you asked:

1. Can one use an Employee class as a key in a hashmap?
2. Consider a class `Person` with 2 attributes: `String name`, `List<String> degrees`. How will you make this class immutable? Advantages and disadvantages?
3. Given `class A` with a synchronized method `m1()`, and creating 2 different objects with 2 different threads executing it, what will be the workaround?
4. Explain object level synchronization vs class level synchronization.
5. Given a list of integers in Java 8, get the sum of the square of all the numbers.
6. Write a query to find the names of the authors who have written more than 10 books from a `BookAuthor` table with columns `Book` and `Author`.
7. Given an array of `n` integers and a number `k`, find the pairs of numbers in the array such that the difference between the pair is `k`.
8. How to implement sorting in a list of `Employee` objects?
9. Possible ways to close/release a database connection in Java, even if an exception occurs.
10. How to make threads run in sequential order?
11. What is cascade in Hibernate?
12. What are triggers in a database?
13. Interview questions on stored procedures.
14. Difference between `INNER JOIN` and `LEFT JOIN`.
15. Difference between `@PostMapping` and `@PutMapping`. Can we do insert using `@PutMapping`?
16. Convert `{1,2,33,4,5,6}` into a `HashMap` using streams.
17. Move zeroes to the end of a list.
18. What is serialization, deserialization, and object stream?
19. Demonstrate creating an immutable class.
20. How does a `ConcurrentHashMap` work?
21. Different scopes in Spring. For a singleton class `A` with a `@Autowired` prototype class `B`, what will be returned in `getB()`?
22. Explain `@Qualifier` in Spring.
23. Explain `@Transactional` in Spring.
24. Caching in Hibernate: L1 and L2 caching.
25. Query to fetch the top 3 salaries from an `Employee` table.
26. Workarounds for slow read/write operations.
27. How to implement authentication in microservices?
28. How to iterate and modify a list of strings simultaneously?
29. How to achieve abstraction and encapsulation using Java code?
30. How to implement 100% abstraction?
31. Is it possible to create an object of an interface in a functional interface?
32. Scenario where you can use an abstract class but not an interface.
33. Demonstrate the immutability of a `String` in Java using hashcode.
34. Print numbers from 1 to 100 without using any numbers in the code.
35. Create a method that takes any datatype object as a parameter and returns it as type `T`.
36. Explain `Optional` class, `Date` time, lambda expression, and streams in Java 8.
37. What is the importance of `serialVersionUID`?
38. Why use `TreeMap` in `Map`? How can we define custom sorting?
39. Custom exceptions and handling them in Spring Boot.
40. Inner class and anonymous inner class.
41. Implement `LinkedList` using inner class for node and next.
42. Map a `Person` entity with an `Address` class in the same database table.
43. If we use `one-to-many` and `many-to-one`, what happens if we swap the functionality for a two-entity relationship?
44. Explain the `one-to-many` and `many-to-one` relationship.
45. Ways of autowiring in Spring: field autowiring, constructor autowiring, setter autowiring. Which is the best?
46. Explain `@Component`, `@Service`, `@Repository`. Why do they extend `@Component`?
47. Create an immutable class with `name` and `rollNo` as member variables.
48. Explain exceptions in Java, their hierarchy, and common interview questions.
49. From an `Employee` class with `ID` and `name`, return unique records using Stream API given 10,000 records with some duplicates.
50. Difference between `HashTable` and `ConcurrentHashMap`.
51. Difference between fail-fast and fail-safe iterators. Filter a list of students having marks more than 50 using `filter`.
52. Get a list of student names.
53. Why use `Comparator` instead of `Comparable` for sorting objects?
54. Custom configuration in a Spring Boot project.
55. What are actuators in Spring Boot?
56. Difference between `PUT`, `PATCH`, and `POST`.
57. Query parameters vs path variables.
